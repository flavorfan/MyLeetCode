## backtrace (Recursion) 递归迭代


## Dynamic Programming  动态规划



## Using stacks


# romote ftp
## Create an SSH tunnel 
ssh -L sourceport:localhost:destinationport user@remoteaddress

ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 nuc@flavorfan.asuscomm.com

## verify that you can see a prompt in the SSH session

## In VS Code, set the port in the debug configuration of launch.json 
    to match the port used in the ssh command and set the host to localhost. 
    You use localhost here because you've set up the SSH tunnel.
## Launch the program and attach the debugger as described in the previous section.
